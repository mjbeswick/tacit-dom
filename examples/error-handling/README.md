# Error Handling with Try/Catch in Tacit-DOM

This example demonstrates how to handle errors gracefully in Tacit-DOM components using try/catch blocks instead of error boundaries.

## Overview

Instead of using error boundaries (which have been removed from Tacit-DOM), this example shows how to implement robust error handling using standard JavaScript try/catch patterns combined with reactive signals.

## Examples Included

### 1. Risky Component

- Demonstrates basic try/catch error handling
- Uses signals to control error state
- Shows how to display different content based on error state

### 2. Async Error Handling

- Shows error handling with async operations
- Demonstrates proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Uses loading states and error states

### 3. Conditional Error Rendering

- Shows how to render completely different UI based on error state
- Demonstrates error recovery and reset functionality
- Uses conditional rendering patterns

### 4. Error Recovery

- Implements retry logic with multiple attempts
- Shows progressive error handling
- Demonstrates state management during error recovery

## Key Concepts

### Try/Catch Patterns

```typescript
try {
  // Risky operation
  const result = someFunction();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error gracefully
  errorSignal.set(error.message);
  return fallbackValue;
}
```

### Error State Management

- Use signals to track error states
- Separate error handling from normal component logic
- Provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Conditional Rendering

- Render different UI based on error state
- Provide fallback content when errors occur
- Allow users to recover from errors

### Async Error Handling

- Handle errors in async operations
- Use finally blocks for cleanup
- Manage loading states during async operations

## Benefits of Try/Catch Over Error Boundaries

1. **More Explicit**: Error handling is visible in the component code
2. **Better Control**: Developers can choose exactly how to handle each error
3. **Simpler**: No complex wrapper functions or configuration
4. **Standard JavaScript**: Uses familiar patterns that all developers know
5. **Flexible**: Can handle different types of errors differently
6. **Testable**: Easier to test error scenarios

## Running the Example

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Best Practices

- Always wrap risky operations in try/catch
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Give users a way to recover from errors
- Use signals to manage error state
- Separate error handling logic from UI logic
- Test error scenarios thoroughly
